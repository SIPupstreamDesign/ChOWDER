## Introduction of 3DWebGIS Distributed Rendering Feature

We added the 3DWebGIS distributed rendering feature.
This feature was developed based on [iTowns](https://github.com/itowns), and by distributing and rendering data across multiple browsers, it is possible to display data in ultra-high resolution and handle data that exceeds the browser's heap memory limit.

### Examples of the 3DWebGIS distributed rendering feature
![Use case 1](https://github.com/SIPupstreamDesign/ChOWDER/blob/master/fig_usecase01.jpg)
An example of 3D WebGIS displayed on a tiled display consisting of 15 4K displays.
