## Introduction of 3DWebGIS Distributed Rendering Feature

We added the 3DWebGIS distributed rendering feature.
This feature was developed based on [iTowns](https://github.com/itowns), and by distributing and rendering data across multiple browsers, it is possible to display data in ultra-high resolution and handle data that exceeds the browser's heap memory limit.
